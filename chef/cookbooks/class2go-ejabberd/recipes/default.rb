# Installing ejabberd and configuring it is fiddly. A lot of material gets 
# created when it's nonexistent, which gives things a slightly magical feeling,
# and not in a good way. Its especially problematic if you start ejabberd with
# one set of settings (such as hostname), and then restart it later with a
# different set. The following set of steps are in the following order because
# this seems to satisfy the requirements for having working ejabberd most
# easily.
#
# This set of recipes must be run after base-ubuntu, so we have a hostname.

# Remove ejabberd and completely destroy existing configuration 
# before doing other things

    action :stop

# Now install ejabberd and dependencies (Big!) with debian-default config
package "ejabberd" do
    action :install
end

# ejabberd is started at installation; stop it and wipe runtime files so we
# can reconfigure
