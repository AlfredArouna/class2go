Instructions for installing the Google Data Python Library:

Mainly taken from https://developers.google.com/gdata/articles/python_client_lib

**Not sure if this works for pc/linux**

1. Download the latest version here:
https://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list

2. Unpack it

3. Run sudo ./setup.py install

4. You can test that it worked by going to the tests/ directory from where you unpacked the library and running
./run_data_tests.py

If you see the tests passing, you should be good to go.
You might get an error that no module gdata was found, this is because the run_data_tests.py file uses a shebang line to run the python interpreter located at
/usr/bin/python, but if this is not where your default python is, it can cause this error.
Simply change this line to /usr/bin/env python, and it will run the correct python from   PATH

*** You will get an error for one of the tests:
Running all tests in module atom_tests.mock_http_test
F..
======================================================================
FAIL: testRecordResponse (atom_tests.mock_http_test.MockHttpClientUnitTest)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/kevluo/Stanford 11-12/Summer/CURIS/gdata-2.0.17/tests/atom_tests/mock_http_test.py", line 49, in testRecordResponse
    self.assertEquals(live_response.status, 200)
AssertionError: 502 != 200

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is fine, it's not a problem with the library, but the google server this test tried to make a request to.

----- So if you made it this far, you should be good to go! -----
