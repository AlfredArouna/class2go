Setting up a dev environment for class2go
=========================================

General Instructions
* Set-up Python
* Set-up Python's virtual env
* Set-up Django
* Set-up Mysql

For MAC OS-X Lion: Instructions mainly taken from 
http://www.tlswebsolutions.com/mac-os-x-lion-setting-up-django-pip-virtualenv-and-homebrew/

=========================================

1. Install XCode 
    Apple App Store

2. Within XCode, add the command line tools
    Preferences -> Download Item -> "Command Line Tools" Install button

3. Install Homebrew:
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"

4. Install Python (we are expecting 2.7.x):
    brew install readline sqlite gdbm 
    brew install python --universal --framework 

5. Install mysql
    brew install mysql
    (Optional but useful for looking at the database)
    Install phpmyadmin (?!) following the directions here:
    http://www.djangoapp.com/blog/2011/07/24/installing-phpmyadmin-on-mac-os-x-lion/

6. Install pip, a python package manager
    easy_install pip

7. Install python's virtual env
    pip install virtualenv 

8. Create the class2go virtual env 
    virtualenv django-class2go --no-site-packages    

    This should create the django-class2go directory under the
    directory where this README is found.  All our django stuff
    will happen in there now.

9. Start using the virtual environment that we just created.  
    . ./django-class2go/bin/activate

    WARNING: you need to do this from whatever shell you're using.
    You can tell this because is puts an environment indicator at
    the beginning of your prompt

9. Install django itself (this will be inside the virtualenv)
    pip install django

10. Install MySQL-python (this will be inside the virtualenv)
    pip install MySQL-python

11. Install python image library (this will be inside the virtualenv)
    pip install PIL

12. Install South, the database schema migration tool: (this will
    be inside the virtualenv)
    easy_install South

13. Setup initial db.
    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate

At this point you should be able to look at the django database in
your local mysql and see a bunch of c2g_* tables.  Yay.
