        <p align="justify">
        <b>Nick McKeown</b> has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at
        Stanford University since 1995. He grew up in the UK and received his BEng from Leeds
        University in 1986. He moved to the US in 1989 to do an MS and PhD in Electrical
        Engineering and Computer Science at University of California at Berkeley. For many years
        his research focused on the analysis, architecture and design of high performance packet
        switches. More recently, he has researched mostly on software-defined networks, new
        Internet architectures and how to evolve the Internet. He loves research problems that are
        intellectually interesting and also have an opportunity to improve the practice of
        networking. He co-founded several companies based on technology started at Stanford,
        including Abrizio (high performance switching), NEMO (network memory), and Nicira
        (software defined networks). He is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, Royal Academy of Engineering
        (UK) and the National Academy of Engineering (US). He received the BCS Lovelace Award in
        2005, the IEEE Kobayashi Award in 2009 and the ACM Sigcomm Award in 2012. He believes the
        right answer to an engineering problem is always beautiful, and almost always very simple.

        <p align="justify">
        <b>Philip Levis</b> is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at
        Stanford University. He received his Sc.B. from Brown University in 1999, his M.S. from
        the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2001, and his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 2005. In
        2008 he received an NSF CAREER award and a Microsoft Research New Faculty Fellowship. He
        researches the design and implementation of networked systems, including operating systems
        and protocols for embedded wireless devices, wireless mesh protocols, network
        infrastructure for virtual worlds, and energy efficient computing. The results of his
        research, including the TinyOS operating system, nesC language, Trickle algorithm, and the
        collection tree protocol (CTP), have been adopted by tens of thousands of users and
        researchers worldwide. He is a co-founder and the President of Kumu Networks. He really
        likes excellent engineering and has a self-destructive aversion to low-hanging fruit.

    <h3>About the Course</h3>
    <p align="justify">
        This is an introductory course on computer networking, speci?cally the Internet. It
        focuses on explaining how the Internet works, ranging from how bits are modulated on wires
        and in wireless to application-level protocols like BitTorrent and HTTP. Students
        implement a handful of low-level protocols and services, including reliable transport, IP
        forwarding, and a Network Address Translation device. Students gain experience reading and
        understanding RFCs (Internet protocol speci?cations) as statements of what a system should
        do. The course grounds many of the concepts in current practice and recent developments,
        such as net neutrality and DNS security.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisistes</h3>
    <p align="justify">Students need an introductory course in probability, a strong understanding of bits andbytes, and knowledge of how computers lay out data in memory.</p>
